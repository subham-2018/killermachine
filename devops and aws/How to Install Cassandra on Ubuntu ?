How to Install Cassandra on Ubuntu ?

check wheather JAVA & PYTHON are available or not as python is pre-installed in ubuntu os we need to get JAVA.

Installing JAVA!
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-set-default

java -version

 Installing Apache Cassandra!
 echo "deb http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 36x main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list

 curl https://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/KEYS | sudo apt-key add -

 sudo apt-get update

 sudo apt-get install cassandra

 nodetool status 

 Connect with cqlsh!

 cqlsh

After Installing Cassandra we need to find it's location ?

cd /etc/
ls
cd cassandra
there you will find a file named as cassandra.yaml we need to backup this file
> cp cassandra.yaml cassandra_backup.yaml

Then we need to get into the Cassandra.yaml!
> sudo nano cassandra.yaml

After Editing the file we just need to restart the Cassandra & check the status wheather it's running or not?
we have to change the config file with the Private IP (seed, rpc_address, listen_address)

> sudo service cassandra restart
> sudo service cassandra status
