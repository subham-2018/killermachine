installed vsftpd
changed anony to no
restarted vsftp
tried connecting from terminal using the command " ftp <server_IP>"
login got dclined. 
Edited security rules from aws console under options "Security Groups". 
created a user subham and gave it a new passwrd. since it is a new user the document root will be /home/subham. I created a file under /home/subham/ 
tried connecting and it got connected but it was not listing the files under the path. 
so i added a few rules in vsftpd.conf
	pasv_enable=YES
    pasv_min_port=1024
	pasv_max_port=1048
	pasv_address=<Public IP of your instance> 
i tried connecting again and it gave me anther error. 
so iadded a new value in vsftpd.con "pasv_promiscuous=YES"
it worked correctly after that.


Go to now terminal and use "ftp -p <server_IP"
